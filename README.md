        In this file, you will have a .sln file named: " Ants and Bugs+Twin CS135 Module 3 Project.sln "                                                         
        Double click this file to open the project, but make sure you have Visual Studio installed. It might ask you to update the code to the current version, that is fine, just         click OK. 
        Once you do this You should see this window: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7bb53c1-18d2-47e7-898d-31a13c3d554b)
